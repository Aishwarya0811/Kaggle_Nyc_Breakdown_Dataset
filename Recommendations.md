In near future queuing algorithm could have been applied to predict delay times of buses. 

There were too many missing values these are human errors and could be improved in the near future for better analysis of delay times.

Try finding alternate route of traversing to and from the schools especially in Bronx and Brooklyn and Manhattan according to our data exploratory analysis.

One more thing while manually entering the delay times a fixed format could have being used.
